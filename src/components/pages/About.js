      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
      I was born in Newark New Jersey on March 10, 1987. Some of my interests include my love for cars (BMW),
              soccer, traveling internationally, and spending time with family.
              I am a film fanatic. Some of my favorite films include the Star Wars series, Lord of the Rings, <mark style="color: red;">The
                Godfather,</mark> Casino, and Devils Advocate. Some of my favorite
              television series are Peaky Blinders, Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, Sons of Anarchy, and Hells Kitchen
              (Guilty-pleasure). Also, I recently became an Uncle and really
              enjoy spending time with my nephew. After being an Uncle for two years now, I am fascinated by how eager
              toddlers are to learn. My nephew never ceases to amaze
              in his willingness to keep on learning (a quick learner)!
